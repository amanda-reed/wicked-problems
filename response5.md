### The Potential of Data Science

In the world of information and technology science, data science is relatively new. With its blend of computer science and mathematical/statistical modeling, this study has revolutionized the way we can interpret data. In our growing world, we face the challenge of being able to analyze and study mass data. Data Science, in its many disciplines, can analyze and predict the future of our world. With the advent of new technology and data every day, data science has the capacity and flexibility to adapt to the new challenges data presents in analyzing the complex interactions within our given environment, business sector, and social world. 

Human behavior has always been a topic of study among scholars. The study of why and how humans interact with each other and their own environment has been used to predict future behavior. Data science has the ability to analyze large sets of data, particularly geospatial data,  to show patterns of migration and settlements. Though they may see a correlation between denser population and waterways or access to transportation, data can also show more complex relationships that directly affect individuals, such as access to healthcare. The variety of ways to model this relationship can reveal more about the data than previous studies could. By layering several sets of data graphically, a clearer correlation can be seen. 

In addition, data science can be extremely useful within the business sector. Though companies are often collecting data about their costumers, it was only until the advent of data science that they could truly understand the mass data collected. With the study of both categorical and numerical features, data scientists can study customer churn and ways to increase retention. Any business that relies on a contract or subscription, such as Netflix, Spotify, or telecommunication services, will benefit from churn prediction models. These models can identify specific factors the increase a consumerâ€™s likelihood to stop using a service or product. Data science, in this way, has the ability to improve performance and increase profit.

Although data science can be extremely useful in increasing productivity and developing a better understanding of our world, it is important to note the responsibility of data scientists. Privacy and the use of personal data has been a topic of increased concern. It seems that every website we visit or interaction we make online is collected as data. Most people accept terms and conditions regarding privacy without truly understanding how their data is used. With great power, comes great responsibility: it is the responsibility of data scientists to handle data sensibly. With their vast understanding of data, these scholars can help policymakers comprehend risks posed and how privacy can be improved.

As we gain more data, we may find that different models better visualize the data to develop a more complex understanding. With the variety of models and methods, data science has the flexibility to study data in new ways. For example, discoveries can be made with the implementation of a map rather than a histogram, or vice versa. All in all, data science can change the way we look at our world. Every interaction and its effects can help us better understand our future. The implications of data science can be applied in every sector of our lives, making it valuable for problems faced today and in our future.
