I gathered data from GADM to plot the subdivisions of Belgium. Using the adm0, adm1, and adm2 shapefiles, I was able to plot the data. I used the simple features and ggplot
packages to plot the layers of data.

I also plotted the subdivisions of Belgium using data from geoBoundaries.

### Stretch Goal 2

Using data from adm1 and adm2, I was able to pipe and filter data from only the Vlaanderen region of Belgium. I then plotted the data, which showed the region in more depth,
including its provinces.
